// A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value. And, elements are served on the basis of their priority. That is, higher priority elements are served first.
// However, if elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.
// Assigning Priority Value
// Generally, the value of the element itself is considered for assigning the priority. For example,
// The element with the highest value is considered the highest priority element. However, in other cases, we can assume the element with the lowest value as the highest priority element.
